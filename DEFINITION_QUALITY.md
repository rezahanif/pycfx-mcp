# Definition-Quality Score — Ansys CFX MCP (pycfx-mcp)
Date scored: 2026-08-23
Commit/version scored: main branch, latest
Scored by: Hermes Agent
Profile: 2 — Thin-proxy/full-exec (20 tools including run_code for sandboxed Python execution)

## A. Schema Completeness (15%)
A1: 2/2  A2: 2/2  A3: 1/2  A4: 1/2  A5: 2/2
Subtotal: 8/10 → normalized: 80/100

- A1 ✅ All parameters typed via Python annotations. Schema derived automatically from handler signatures via `schema_from_signature()`.
- A2 ✅ All tool descriptions are detailed, domain-specific, and include parameter docs. `_TOOLSET_CATALOGUE` provides additional context per toolset.
- A3 ⚠️ CFX-specific units (pressure, temperature) mentioned in descriptions but not consistently across all tools.
- A4 ⚠️ `_CFX_STATIC_ALLOWED_VALUES` defines allowed values for turbulence models, heat transfer, flow regime — but as tuples, not Python enums. Agent sees them via `cfx_model_context` queries, not schema-level enums.
- A5 ✅ Required vs optional fully declared via Python defaults.

## B. Semantic Disambiguation (20%)
B1: 2/2  B2: 2/2  B3: 2/2  B4: 2/2  B5: 2/2
Subtotal: 10/10 → normalized: 100/100

- B1 ✅ All 20 tools are domain-specific: `cfx_workflow`, `cfx_model_context`, `solver_status`, `find_api`, `get_state`, etc. No generic passthrough names.
- B2 ✅ Zero naming collisions. Each tool maps to a unique operation.
- B3 ✅ Full CRUD pairing: `list_named_objects` ↔ `find_named_object` ↔ `select_named_objects`. State reading (`get_state`) paired with context queries (`get_targeted_context`).
- B4 ✅ Pre-conditions consistently stated via `_TOOLSET_CATALOGUE` skills: "Call session_status to check connectivity before other operations", "Use validate_code before running generated Python".
- B5 ✅ Strict snake_case convention throughout. Toolset catalogue provides consistent categorization.

## C. Error Contract Clarity (15%)
C1: 2/2  C2: 2/2  C3: 1/2  C4: 2/2  C5: 2/2
Subtotal: 9/10 → normalized: 90/100

- C1 ✅ Structured error codes: `backend_unavailable`, `not_connected`, `invalid_arguments`, `upstream_error`, `discovery_error`, `internal_error`, `syntax_error`, `forbidden_call`, `forbidden_import`, `forbidden_name`. TypedError model carries code + message + details.
- C2 ✅ Explicit envelope via `TypedError` model. `typed_guard` decorator converts all exceptions to typed payloads. RunCodeResult has `status: "ok" | "error"` + `error_code`.
- C3 ⚠️ Error messages are descriptive but `nextRecommendedActions` not systematically populated. `error_remediation` tool provides remediation answers but is a separate tool, not embedded in error responses.
- C4 ✅ No empty catch blocks. `typed_guard` catches all exceptions and converts to TypedError. Logging via `logger.exception()` for unhandled errors.
- C5 ✅ Connection errors (`NotConnectedError`, `BackendUnavailableError`) clearly distinguishable from semantic errors (`InvalidArgumentsError`) and upstream errors (`UpstreamError`).

## D. Stub / Dead-Code Detection (15%)
D1: 2/2  D2: 2/2  D3: 2/2  D4: 2/2  D5: 2/2
Subtotal: 10/10 → normalized: 100/100

- D1 ✅ All files non-empty with substantial implementations. No zero-byte files.
- D2 ✅ Zero TODO/FIXME/unimplemented markers in active code.
- D3 ✅ No `raise NotImplementedError` or placeholder throws. All handlers are fully implemented.
- D4 ✅ All 20 tools registered via `_register_tools()` with explicit `if "tool_name" in self._exposed` guards. No silent-skip possible — loader errors surface as missing tools.
- D5 ✅ All handler parameters map to actual usage. No orphaned schema fields.

## E. Coverage vs. Vendor Spec (10%)
E1: ~60%  E2: ~60%  E3: 2/2
Normalized: 75/100

- E1 Ansys CFX API surface includes thousands of settings paths (domains, boundaries, materials, solver settings, output controls). The 20 tools provide general-purpose access via `run_code` (sandboxed) and `cfx_model_context` (structured queries). `_CFX_API_CATALOG` covers 18 key API paths. Direct tool coverage is lower but `run_code` + `find_api` + `get_state` cover the full API surface indirectly.
- E2 All 20 tools are real implementations. No stubs. `run_code` sandbox (AST validation, forbidden call blocking, import restrictions) is production-grade.
- E3 ✅ Core CFX operations fully covered: session lifecycle (connect/disconnect/status), workflow actions (start_pre, import_mesh, write_def, start_solver, wait_solver, open_post), model context queries, code execution, visualization (screenshot), error remediation.

## F. Exec-Pattern API Guidance (25%)
F1: 2/2  F2: 2/2  F3: 2/2  F4: 2/2  F5: 2/2
Subtotal: 10/10 → normalized: 100/100

- F1 ✅ `find_api` provides keyword-based semantic search across the CFX API tree. `get_help` returns docstrings and child listings. `get_targeted_context` provides batched disambiguation (active-status + state + allowed-values + child-names in one round-trip). `cfx_model_context` has `api_help`, `find_api`, `allowed_values` actions. Covers ≥80% of vendor API classes.
- F2 ✅ `cfx_workflow` provides 8 pre-routed lifecycle actions (start_pre, import_mesh, write_def, start_solver, wait_solver, get_results_file, open_post, status). `_CFX_API_CATALOG` provides 18 documented API paths with descriptions and search tokens. Recipes module provides additional tested workflows.
- F3 ✅ `_CFX_API_CATALOG` provides 18 seeded API entries. `_CFX_STATIC_ALLOWED_VALUES` provides allowed values for turbulence models, heat transfer, flow regime. `cfx_model_context` with `allowed_values` action provides live API enumeration. Registry grows via `find_api` and `get_help` queries.
- F4 ✅ Agent can complete core + intermediate CFX workflows without web search: connect → query model context → set parameters via `run_code` → validate → execute → check solver status → get results. `error_remediation` provides workflow guidance.
- F5 ✅ Toolset definitions provide immediate value on first run. `_TOOLSET_CATALOGUE` gives structured skill guidance per toolset. `cfx_workflow` with pre-routed actions works without any prior knowledge.

## TOTAL: (80 × 0.15) + (100 × 0.20) + (90 × 0.15) + (100 × 0.15) + (75 × 0.10) + (100 × 0.25) = 12 + 20 + 13.5 + 15 + 7.5 + 25 = **93.0 / 100**

## Notable findings
- **Highest-scoring connector in the portfolio** at 93/100.
- **B=100**: Perfect semantic disambiguation — 20 domain-specific tools, zero collisions, full CRUD pairing, consistent naming, pre-conditions documented.
- **D=100**: Flawless codebase — zero stubs, zero TODOs, zero dead code, all tools properly registered with explicit guards.
- **F=100**: Best-in-class Layer B guidance — `find_api` (semantic search), `get_help` (docstrings), `get_targeted_context` (batched disambiguation), `_CFX_API_CATALOG` (18 seeded entries), `_CFX_STATIC_ALLOWED_VALUES` (allowed values), `error_remediation` (upstream chat).
- **Security**: `run_code` sandbox is production-grade — AST validation, forbidden call blocking (os.system, subprocess, eval, exec), import restrictions, dunder protection, TUI escape hatch blocking.
- **Architecture**: `typed_guard` decorator + `TypedError` model = consistent error contract across all 20 tools. Exception hierarchy covers 6 error types.
- **Minor gap**: C3 — `nextRecommendedActions` not embedded in error responses (exists as separate `error_remediation` tool instead).

## Correction — 2026-08-28 (bundle benchmark)

Scored 2026-08-23 against a 20-defined / 7-exposed profile. Two claims above no longer hold as
written, and one number was always wrong:

- **`_CFX_API_CATALOG` covers 20 paths, not 18** (E1). AST-counted at `cfx/backend.py:301-469`.
- **B=100 "zero naming collisions / each tool maps to a unique operation" was falsified by
  `c74703d`**, which exposed `search_cfx_api` alongside `find_api` and `query_cfx_registry`
  alongside `get_help` — two names for one backend call, both listed at once. It is true again
  only because the benchmark removed the duplicates. Re-score against the current 18-tool profile
  before quoting 93.0.
- **F=100 rested on `find_api` + `get_help` being directly exposed.** They are — and the aliases
  that briefly shadowed them are gone.
- **D=100 "no stubs, no silent-skip" needs one asterisk**: `get_results` returned
  `{"status": "ok", "results_file": null}` from empty state until 2026-08-28 (N44), which is a
  silent degradation the D-dimension is meant to catch. `get_version` still reports the Python
  wrapper's version while claiming to report the Ansys CFX version (N43).
